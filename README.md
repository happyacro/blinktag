I miss the &lt;blink&gt; tag. Don't you?

Documentation is dumb. Just go look at the [demo](http://www.happyacro.com/blinktag.html), or clone this repo and check out blinktag.html.

You're welcome.

Check out my cool Web 5.0 website hosted on a .com domain that has vowels, because that's how the internet works when you're clever enough to come up with an original domain rather than cop out with .io whatever.

All scripts are licensed with the [Apache license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_license), which is a great license because, essentially it:

* a) covers liability - my code should work, but I'm not liable if you do something stupid with it
* b) allows you to copy, fork, and use the code, even commercially
* c) is [non-viral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_license), that is, your derivative code doesn't *have to be* open source to use it

Other great licensing options for your own code: [BSD License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses), [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), or [Creative Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license).
